# TubaSynth
Synthesizer that emulates the sound of a Tuba using input from a hardware "mouthpiece" and "valves".

Synthesizer borrowed from my other project, [BasicSynth](https://github.com/danieltmc/BasicSynth/ "BasicSynth")

Arduino-compatible device required for valve input.  Preferably something from the [ESP Family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP8266), like an [ESP32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32), due to its higher clock speed.

The Arduino-compatible device will function as a MIDI controller, so it can feasibly be used with other MIDI capable software and hardware synthesizers to better suit the listener's taste.
